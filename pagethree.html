         <p>One of the best video games I've ever played is Red Dead Redemption 2. It's story is amazing, the gameplay is really fun, and it's an incredibly long game. It also has an online mode to play with others. I really think you should check it out.

         <p>Although my favorite video game is Red Dead Redemption 2, my favorite video game franchise is the Monster Hunter franchise. The entire game revolves around killing massive dinosaurs with huge weapons, and honestly, it's really fun. Soon, a new Monster Hunter Game is coming out on the Nintendo Switch, and I'd recommend getting it if you have a Switch.</p>

         <p>One of my favorite things is playing card games. Right now, I play a lot of Magic The Gathering. It's really fun, but with the restrictions of COVID-19 I'm stuck with playing the online version, which isn't as good as playing with physical cards.</p>
